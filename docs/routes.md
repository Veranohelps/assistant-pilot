# Route

## Models

### Route

A route at its core is just a LineString (a set of point coordinates) with associated data.
field|type|nullable|description
-|-|-|-
id|string|false|route's unique identifier
name|string|false|route's name
originId|string|false|id of the route's origin. Currently, possible origins are dersu, garmin, strava and manual
globalId|string|false|this ID will be associated with this route across copies or duplication i.e duplicating a route will create a route with a different id but the same globalId
ownerId|string|true|ID of the user that created this route, this field would be null for routes from non-user origins e.g. dersu
coordinate|geometry|false|actual coordinates for this route returned as GeoJSON

### RouteOrigin

Route origins are sources for Routes on Dersu. As at the time of writing this, possible route origins are:

- Dersu (Routes provided and curated by Dersu)
- Strava
- Garmin
- Manual (Routes uploaded by users via gpx files)

| field | type   | nullable | description                |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------- |
| id    | string | false    | origin's unique identifier |
| name  | string | false    | origin's name              |

```
[
    {
        "range": "0-999",

                "pictoCode": 5
            }
        ]
    }
]
```


#### Notes

- As the globalId is an implementation detail for routes, it is omitted from all client API responses
- Units for the predicion variables:
  
  ```
        "temperature": "C",
        "precipitation": "mm",
        "precipitationProbability": "percent",
        "visibility": "m",
        "cloudCover": "percent",
        "sunshineTime": "minutes"
        "windSpeed": "ms-1",
        "windGust": "ms-1",
        "isDay": "0-night, 1-day",
        "pictoCode": "1-35 codes, differents for night/day, i.e. 1 for isDay=0 is a different image than 1 for isDay=1"
  ```
- As we are using Meteoblue API, for forecast days 8 â€“ 14, you get trend data. 1h data is for technical simplification only, there is no skill in 1h 14 day forecasts.
